FINAL NOTE: 
I made very poor progress on this project in terms of code, but I do have a decent amount of research which is in the additionlly attached PDF/Word document. In it ai reflect my progressive steps taken to tackle this project. I know that I have one VERY late commit on 5/11/2019 it was supposed to be 5/1/2019 (still very late) I didnt see the need to commiting each "journal" entry I made in the extra document but it does outline projectt thought the semseter. Thanks Iman!
